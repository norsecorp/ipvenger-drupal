-- SUMMARY --

IPVenger protects your Drupal installation by blocking access by IPs associated
with high-risk behavior.

IPVenger uses NorseCorp IPViking real-time threat assessment technology to
evaluate each IP requesting access to your WordPress site. When a request comes
in, the IP address is sent to the IPViking server, which assigns a numerical
risk factor based on real-time data. IPs whose risk factor exceeds a 
user-configurable threshold are blocked before they can harm your site. Detailed
analytics are provided, as is the ability to blacklist specific IP addresses and
countries of origin.Â

-- FAQ --
Q: How can I test out this module without having a service plan from IPVenger?

A: Add $conf['IPVengerServiceFake'] = TRUE; to your settings.php to give this
   module a test drive.  It will randomly block pages.  Then you can review the
   great analytics available within this module (requires ipvenger_reports).


Q: Sometimes it takes a really long time for the block page to render. Why?

A: This module uses cron to initiate generation of its Captcha images.  If the
   site has turned off cron, consider turning it back on.
